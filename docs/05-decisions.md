### Project name: Junjo

**Decision:** the product is named **Junjo** (Japanese 順序, "order/sequence").

**Considered alternatives:**
- Lubeo (Latin "I command") - harder to pronounce, less memorable
- Jubeo (Latin variant) - same problem
- Aufgabe (German "task") - too consonant-heavy for international devs

**Why Junjo wins:** short, catchy, semantically maps to "proper order" which is what role/permission systems enforce. Slightly Japanese-loanword-flavored which fits the gaming aesthetic.

**Caveats:**
- Existing dev at `junjo.dev` is unrelated - different person, no collaboration. Worth noting for SEO confusion risk.
- npm package `junjo` is taken - we'll use scoped packages: `@junjo/sdk`, `@junjo/react`, `@junjo/roblox`. Need to register the `@junjo` org on npm, or fall back to `@junjo-dev`.
- Domain: `junjo.io` is available. Register before announcing anywhere.

### Backend stack: Node + TypeScript + Postgres + Prisma

**Decision:** Node + TypeScript + Postgres + Prisma. Same as PokeDnD.

**Rationale:**
- Gabe's strongest stack - fastest iteration
- PokeDnD (547 commits, real-time multiplayer, complex domain) proves this stack handles the workload
- Postgres + Prisma migration story is mature and well-understood
- When/if revenue justifies it, hot-path Go rewrite is an option - premature now

### Backend framework: TBD (Hono vs Fastify)

**Open question.** Both are lightweight and fast. Decide at scaffolding time. Likely Hono for edge-compatibility flexibility.

### API style: REST + SSE + webhooks

**Decision:** REST for CRUD, SSE for real-time push, webhooks for outbound events.

**Why not WebSockets:** SSE handles the use case with less connection-state complexity. Most "real-time" needs in this domain are server-to-client push, not bidirectional.

**Why not GraphQL:** REST is simpler, more familiar to game devs, easier to document. No compelling reason to add GQL complexity.

**Why not gRPC:** REST is enough. Game devs are not enterprise.

### Auth: BYO via adapter pattern

**Decision:** Junjo never replaces the dev's auth provider. Adapter pattern: `verifyToken(token) → { userId } | null`. Built-in adapters for Clerk, Supabase, raw JWT. BYO callback for everything else.

**Rationale:**
- Gabe's direct experience with Ory friction → strong evidence devs hate having auth dictated
- Doing one thing well and composing > trying to be everything
- Massive infra simplification: we don't store passwords, send emails, run OAuth flows, or handle account recovery

### Persistence: Postgres only

**Decision:** Postgres only. Self-host accepts `DATABASE_URL`. Cloud uses Supabase or Neon.

**Rejected:** MongoDB (different consistency model fragments codebase), SQLite (fine for tests, not production), Postgres-native API (overkill).

### V1 SDKs: TypeScript + Roblox/Luau

**Decision:** ship two SDKs at V1 launch - `@junjo/sdk` (TS, Node + browser) and `junjo-roblox` (Luau).

**Deferred:**
- Unity / C# (V2) - Unity Asset Store packaging is real work; wait for V1 traction signal
- Godot / GDScript (V3) - smaller market
- Unreal / C++ - never unless validated

**Why TS + Roblox first:**
- TS = Gabe's strongest language + biggest indie web audience (Three.js, Phaser)
- Roblox = he can dogfood with `mobarena-roblox` immediately, real first user from day one

### Core entity name: Group (not Guild)

**Decision:** the core entity is `Group` in the API. Devs set a `kind` string ("guild", "clan", "faction", etc.) for their UI.

**Why:** "Guild" leaks one game's vocabulary into the SDK. "Group" is generic enough to fit clans, factions, parties, crews, squads. The dev's UI shows whatever label they want.

### Group relationships are V1

**Decision:** include group-to-group relationships (`ally`, `enemy`, `neutral`, custom strings) in V1.

**Why:** Minecraft Factions, WoW horde-vs-alliance, faction-war PvP games all need this. Tiny data model. Big game-design unlock.

### V1 scope: everything (all-at-once release)

**Decision:** Gabe explicitly chose to ship the full V1 scope (including everything originally listed as V2) before public launch. Estimated 32-40 weekends, ~8-10 months at 1 weekend/week.

**Rejected alternative:** phased shipping (3-4 month v1.0 core, then monthly v1.1+ updates).

**Why all-at-once:** Gabe wants this to be a polished passion project, not a scrappy MVP. Accepts the longer time-to-launch.

**Risk:** scope creep + never shipping is the killer of 80% of side projects. **Mitigation:**
- Strict feature freeze 1 month before launch - no new features after that
- Real internal dogfooding via mobarena-roblox during development
- Use Revelations as a second dogfood target if it makes sense (TS SDK)
- Monthly progress check-in to prevent indefinite drift

### Monetization: open-core

**Decision:** OSS SDK + Docker server image (MIT) + paid managed cloud.

**Free tier limits:** 1 game, 100 monthly active members, 1 group max, 5 roles.

**Pricing tiers (proposed; tune after launch):** $20 / $100 / $500 / Enterprise.

**See [docs/04-monetization.md](./04-monetization.md) for full math.**

### Repo structure: monorepo with npm workspaces

**Decision:** single `junjo/` repo with `packages/` (server, sdk, react, sdk-roblox, shared) and `apps/` (dashboard, docs).

**Why monorepo:** atomic refactors across SDK + server when API shape changes. Shared types via `@junjo/shared`. Single CI pipeline.

**Why npm workspaces (not pnpm or Turborepo):** lowest setup cost. pnpm/Turborepo are overkill for ~6 packages. Revisit if build time becomes painful.

### Tooling

- TypeScript strict mode + project references
- `tsup` for builds (fast, dual ESM/CJS)
- Vitest for tests in every package
- Biome for lint + format (replaces ESLint + Prettier)
- GitHub Actions for CI
- `release-please` for versioning (or Changesets - TBD)

### Validation strategy: skipped

**Decision:** Gabe explicitly chose not to do a public validation post (Reddit, etc.).

**Reason given:** concern about idea theft via LLMs.

**Counter that was acknowledged but not adopted:** in dev tools, ideas are nearly worthless and execution is everything. Auth0/Stripe/Vercel weren't first to their categories.

**Implication:** we're betting on execution + dogfooding (mobarena-roblox) as the validation signal, not external interest. If the dogfooding doesn't surface real demand from the Roblox community, that's the first warning sign.

### Backend framework: Hono

**Decision:** Hono for `packages/server`.

**Why:** lean, TS-first, pairs with the "thin focused API" philosophy. Edge-runtime flexibility kept open even though V1 ships single-instance Node. Fastify's plugin ecosystem isn't worth its extra ceremony for an API this focused.

**Trade:** thinner middleware ecosystem than Fastify. We'll write a bit more glue (rate-limiting, observability hooks). Acceptable at this scale.

### Versioning: Changesets

**Decision:** Changesets for monorepo versioning + changelog generation.

**Why:** de-facto standard for TS monorepos (pnpm, Vercel, tRPC, Astro all use it). The per-PR changeset file is small friction that yields materially better changelogs than release-please's commit-message-driven output. SDK users actually read changelogs to decide on upgrades; quality matters there.

**Config:** `access: "public"`, `baseBranch: "main"`. `apps/*` and `examples/*` are ignored (cloud-only and example apps don't get versioned releases).

### Docs site: Nextra

**Decision:** Nextra for `apps/docs`.

**Why:** same Next.js stack as `apps/dashboard`, so one framework knowledge for both apps. MDX, search, sidebar built-in. Docusaurus is the safe-but-old choice and brings its own React/build pipeline. Plain Next.js is too much custom work.

**Trade:** no versioned-docs UI out of the box. Defer that until V2 (V1 ships one version of the docs).

### Cloud-only code license: proprietary / All Rights Reserved

**Decision:** `apps/dashboard` and any cloud-only server modules are "All Rights Reserved" via `apps/dashboard/LICENSE` + a `license` field in `package.json`. They live in the public monorepo (visible) but are not legally reusable.

**Why:** simplest option that prevents the AWS-fork scenario. BSL (Sentry/HashiCorp model) adds licensing-language complexity for zero benefit until someone is actually trying to fork-and-resell, which is a Year-3 problem at the earliest. Proprietary is reversible (can move to BSL or even MIT later); BSL is harder to walk back.

### Type-checking split: Biome + tsc

**Decision:** Biome for lint + format. `tsc --noEmit` per package for type-checking. Separate steps in CI.

**Why:** Biome doesn't yet do TS type-checking. This is the standard pattern for Biome shops.

### Package naming

**Decision:** `packages/sdk` (publishes `@junjo/sdk`), `packages/react` (publishes `@junjo/react`), `packages/sdk-roblox` (Roblox marketplace + GitHub release; not on npm).

**Why:** TS is the canonical SDK, so no language suffix. Same pattern as Stripe (`stripe` on npm = the Node/TS SDK; `stripe-go`, `stripe-python` get explicit suffixes). Roblox is the outlier because it isn't on npm - different distribution channel justifies the suffix.

**Supersedes:** the earlier `packages/sdk-ts` reference in `README.md`. README updated this date.

### Server test fixture: `TEST_DATABASE_URL` env var (not testcontainers)

**Decision:** server-side tests that need a database read a connection string from `TEST_DATABASE_URL`. Tests fail fast with a clear error if the env var is unset. We do NOT depend on `testcontainers` for V1.

**Rationale:**
- Docker is not a guaranteed dependency on Windows dev machines or in the current overnight loop runner. Hard-requiring it would block iterations whenever Docker Desktop is not running.
- A single shared local Postgres (the dev brings up however they like - Docker, Postgres.app, Supabase local, etc.) is meaningfully faster per test run than spinning up a fresh container.
- The cost of swapping in `testcontainers` later is small: it would replace the env-var resolution inside `packages/server/src/testdb.ts` and nothing else.

**Trade:** developers must set `TEST_DATABASE_URL` once locally. A short-lived setup pain in exchange for not coupling the test step to Docker.

**Caveats:**
- Tests truncate / reset the schema between files. Anyone pointing this env var at a database with real data will lose it. The README warns about that.
- Revisit when there is a second human running tests regularly, or when isolation across parallel test suites becomes a real problem.

### API key format: `prefix.secret`, scrypt-hashed at rest

**Decision:** API keys are issued as `{prefix}.{secret}`. The prefix is stored in plaintext (and indexed) for O(1) lookup; the secret is hashed with Node's built-in `scrypt` and stored as `scrypt$<salt-b64>$<key-b64>`. The plaintext secret is shown to the developer once, at issuance, and is never recoverable from the database.

**Rationale:**
- A database leak should not be sufficient to act as the developer. Plaintext secrets fail that bar.
- `scrypt` is built into Node's `crypto`, so this adds no new dependency. `argon2` and `bcrypt` would both pull in native bindings.
- The `prefix.secret` split lets the lookup path be exactly one indexed query plus one scrypt verify. Trying every row is not on the table.
- The stored format is self-describing (`scrypt$...`) so a future move to argon2 or a parameter bump can coexist with old hashes.

**Trade:** scrypt CPU cost is non-trivial per request (single-digit ms). Acceptable for an API-key path that is hit once per request and is also a candidate for caching later if it shows up in profiles.

### Server middleware uses dependency-injected stores

**Decision:** server middleware that needs to talk to the database accepts a small store interface, not the full `PrismaClient`. Production wiring (in `createApp()`) builds the store from the singleton client; tests inject an in-memory fake.

**Rationale:**
- Phase 0.2 ships before Phase 0.3 (the first migration), so middleware tests cannot rely on a live schema yet. DI lets the logic be tested today and rewired tomorrow when the migration lands.
- Even after migrations land, the fake-store path stays useful for fast unit tests that do not need to exercise SQL.
- The interface is intentionally narrow (one or two methods per middleware) so the cost of keeping it in sync is small.

**Pattern:** see `packages/server/src/middleware/apiKey.ts` (`ApiKeyStore`) and `packages/server/src/app.ts` (default wiring).

### Server `createApp()` factory returns a fresh Hono app per call

**Decision:** the runnable entry point (`src/index.ts`) calls a `createApp(opts?)` factory exported from `src/app.ts` rather than constructing the app at module load. Tests call the same factory to boot a per-file app instance.

**Rationale:** lets each test file own its own Hono instance, its own middleware wiring, and its own injected stores without globals leaking across files. Matches the "Server tests use a real Postgres test database... one container per test run" convention in `VISION.md` while leaving room for the in-memory fake-store path described above.

### `prisma generate` runs as a `postinstall` script in `@junjo/server`

**Decision:** `packages/server/package.json` includes `"postinstall": "prisma generate"`. A fresh clone running `npm install` therefore ends up with a generated Prisma client without any manual follow-up step.

**Rationale:**
- The typecheck step imports types from `@prisma/client`. Without a generated client the type information is empty, breaking `tsc --noEmit` in `packages/server` and any downstream package that re-exports from it.
- `prisma generate` is idempotent and fast (sub-second), so paying it on every install is cheap.
- Deferring it to a manual `npm run prisma:generate` was the previous policy; iteration 002's notes flagged that the first migration iteration should wire it up automatically because that is the moment fresh-clone reproducibility starts to matter.

**Trade:** if `prisma generate` ever fails (corrupt schema, unsupported Node version), `npm install` fails too. Acceptable: a broken schema should fail loudly at install time, not silently produce a tree that fails much later in `tsc`.

### Database commands live behind named `npm run db:*` scripts

**Decision:** the developer-facing database commands are spelled `npm run db:migrate` (deploy applied migrations), `npm run db:migrate:dev` (create + apply a new migration after a schema edit), and `npm run db:reset` (drop + reapply every migration; skip seed). All live in `packages/server/package.json`.

**Rationale:** the underlying `prisma migrate ...` invocations are easy to mistype and the wrong subcommand can do real damage. Naming them once, in the package that owns the schema, makes the README short and the CI / Docker / overnight-loop calls consistent. The same names also mirror what self-hosters will see in the eventual deploy-time docs (`npm run db:migrate` is what the Docker entrypoint will call).

**Trade:** one more abstraction layer. Worth it for the consistency win and to avoid the `prisma migrate dev` vs `prisma migrate deploy` confusion that bites Prisma newcomers.

### Seed helpers accept an optional Prisma client; CLI lives in a sibling file

**Decision:** `packages/server/src/seed.ts` exports `createGame(name, client?)` and `createApiKey(gameId, client?)` as plain async functions whose second argument is an optional `PrismaClient`. The runnable CLI lives at `packages/server/src/seed.cli.ts` and is wired up as `npm run db:seed`. `seed.ts` itself has no top-level side effects.

**Rationale:**
- VISION calls out that the helpers serve "tests + local dev." Tests need to pass a `PrismaClient` bound to `TEST_DATABASE_URL`; the local-dev path wants the singleton from `src/db.ts`. Optional second arg supports both without two function shapes.
- Splitting the runnable CLI into a sibling file (instead of gating with `import.meta.url === pathToFileURL(process.argv[1]).href`) keeps `seed.ts` purely importable. No "is this the entry point" branch to reason about and no risk of CLI side effects firing during a test import.
- The CLI prints the plaintext secret exactly once with a comment that it cannot be recovered later, matching the `prefix.secret` decision (2026-04-28).

**Trade:** two files instead of one. Negligible cost; the CLI body is ~30 lines.

### Group default visibility is `invite-only`

**Decision:** when `POST /v1/groups` is called without a `visibility` field, the server stores `"invite-only"`. The same default applies in the SDK type (`CreateGroupInput.visibility` is optional).

**Rationale:**
- "Invite-only" is the safest of the three options. A new guild that accidentally lands as `"public"` is a privacy regression for the dev's players; a new guild that lands as `"invite-only"` and needs to become public is a one-line dev-side update. Default to the strict end.
- Most genre conventions match: WoW guilds, Discord servers, and Minecraft factions are all "you join because someone let you in" by default.
- A `"secret"` default would be too restrictive (the dev cannot list groups in their own UI without extra plumbing).

**Trade:** devs who want every group public will set `visibility: "public"` explicitly. One extra field per call is cheap.

### Group wire format: ISO 8601 strings on the wire, `Date` in the SDK

**Decision:** the JSON body returned by `POST /v1/groups` (and every future Group-emitting route) carries timestamps as ISO 8601 strings. The SDK rehydrates them into `Date` instances inside `deserializeGroup` (in `packages/sdk/src/groups.ts`). The shared type `Group.createdAt: Date` describes the SDK-side shape; the wire-side `WireGroup` interface is a parallel type local to the SDK.

**Rationale:**
- JSON has no native date type. Serializing dates as ISO 8601 strings is the standard wire choice (and `JSON.stringify(new Date())` already does it).
- Keeping the wire type separate from the user-facing `Group` lets us surface dates as `Date` without forcing the server route to invent a non-JSON encoding.
- Branded ids are reattached at the same boundary (`as GroupId`, `as GameId`) so callers never have to cast in user code.

**Trade:** every resource that has timestamps needs a small `deserializeX` function in its sub-namespace file. Cheap; pays for itself the first time a caller does `group.createdAt.getTime()` without ceremony.

### Server route modules use a `Router(prisma)` factory shape

**Decision:** route modules under `packages/server/src/routes/` export a factory function that takes the shared `PrismaClient` and returns a fresh `Hono` sub-app. `app.ts` calls each factory once per `createApp()` invocation and mounts it under the right path. Co-located Zod schemas live in a sibling `<resource>.schema.ts`.

**Rationale:**
- Mirrors the dependency-injection pattern already used by the API-key middleware (`apiKeyMiddleware(store)`). One pattern across the file tree, one less thing to remember.
- Tests that pass an injected `PrismaClient` to `createApp({ prisma })` get the same client all the way down to the route handlers without globals.
- Co-locating Zod schemas in `<resource>.schema.ts` keeps the route file readable and makes the schema importable by future client-side validation if we ever want it.

**Trade:** one extra layer of indirection (the factory). Negligible cost; opens the door for per-resource feature flags or test doubles later without rewriting handlers.

### SDK splits sub-namespaces into per-resource files; shared `HttpClient` is injected

**Decision:** `packages/sdk/src/index.ts` no longer holds every sub-namespace class. As each namespace lands real (non-stub) methods, it moves into its own file (`groups.ts`, `roles.ts`, ...) and receives the shared `HttpClient` via constructor. `JunjoError` lives in `errors.ts`. Stubbed namespaces stay inline in `index.ts` until they get filled in. The `Junjo` constructor wires `HttpClient` into every namespace that has been extracted.

**Rationale:**
- The convention from VISION says "Sub-namespace classes receive the shared HTTP helper via constructor. The `Junjo` top-level class wires them up." This decision says how that splits across files in practice.
- Putting all wire types and deserializers in `index.ts` would explode it as Phase 1+ adds methods. One file per namespace keeps each file small enough to read end-to-end.
- Splitting only when a namespace gets real methods avoids churn: the stub-only `RolesApi`, `MembersApi`, etc. stay inline in `index.ts` until their phase ships and they need the HTTP client.

**Trade:** index.ts and per-namespace files both define classes. Acceptable; `index.ts` is the public entry and per-namespace files are the implementation modules it imports from.

### Server vitest runs files serially (`fileParallelism: false`)

**Decision:** `packages/server/vitest.config.ts` sets `test.fileParallelism: false`. DB-backed test files stay isolated by truncating shared tables in `beforeEach`; running them in parallel races those truncates against each other. Serializing files keeps the fixture story simple.

**Rationale:**
- The simplest alternative (one Postgres database per test file) would push the per-file setup cost from milliseconds (truncate) to seconds (database-create + migrate). Bad trade for a 7-file suite.
- A separate Postgres schema per file would work but adds a `?schema=...` query-param dance to every test's `PrismaClient` construction. The truncate strategy is what `seed.test.ts` already established; serializing files preserves that pattern as more route tests land.
- Throughput cost is negligible: the whole server suite runs in under 8 seconds with serialization on, dominated by scrypt verifies in the API-key tests.

**Trade:** if the suite grows past ~30 seconds, revisit. Per-file Postgres schemas are the next step; the file-level truncate code stays the same.

### DB-backed tests skip cleanly when `TEST_DATABASE_URL` is unset

**Decision:** integration tests that require a live Postgres (currently `src/seed.test.ts`) wrap their `describe` block in `describe.skipIf(!process.env.TEST_DATABASE_URL)` and instantiate their own `PrismaClient` from the env var, instead of importing the singleton.

**Rationale:**
- The verify gate runs `npm test` with `--passWithNoTests`. If `TEST_DATABASE_URL` is unset, DB-backed tests must skip rather than error so the gate stays green for contributors who have not set up Postgres yet.
- Importing the singleton from `src/db.ts` would force DB-backed tests to either depend on `DATABASE_URL` (different env var) or to pollute the singleton with the test URL. Local instantiation keeps the test self-contained and disconnects in `afterAll`.
- Reset-between-tests is `TRUNCATE TABLE "ApiKey", "Game" RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE` rather than `prisma migrate reset`. Truncate is sub-10ms; `migrate reset` is multi-second. The migration story is exercised once at fixture setup time (the developer runs `npm run db:migrate` against `TEST_DATABASE_URL` once); per-test isolation is just row cleanup.

**Trade:** two ways to talk to the DB in test code (singleton for app tests, locally-instantiated client for DB-direct tests). The split mirrors the production reality (app code uses the singleton; one-off scripts and tests can open their own connection) so it is not extra cognitive load.

## Open questions

- Initial domain: `junjo.io` only, or also grab `junjo.gg` (gaming TLD) as redirect?
- npm org: try to claim `@junjo` first, fallback to `@junjo-dev` if taken
